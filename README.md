# vSequencer (client)
A video sequencer built in Processing (https://processing.org/)

Vision: A video sequencing VJ platform consisting of a client and server.
  - Client: Handles all tempo and sequencing controls. Runs on a Raspberry PI with a custom-designed interface (touch screen and physical buttons). Communicates tempo and sequencing data to the server.
  - Server: Handles network communication and image/video creation.

Done:
  - built Metronome object to control tempo. Tempo is set manually via button control (tap), and testing shows it is sufficiently relaible.
  -
